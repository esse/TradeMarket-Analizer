The canonical version of Beautiful Soup is the Python 2 version. You
can generate the Python 3 version by running to3.sh, or by doing what
to3.sh does: run 2to3 on BeautifulSoup.py and BeautifulSoupTests.py,
then applying the appropriate .3.diff file to each generated script.

The testall.sh script tests both the Python 2 version and a freshly
generated Python 3 version.
